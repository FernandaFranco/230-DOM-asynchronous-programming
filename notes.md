* DOM

  * JavaScript is the syntax, the DOM is where stuff goes down. A DOM node can be a DOM element, a text node, a comment, or other types. DOM nodes have properties.

  * Browsers insert missing elements like `HEAD` and `BODY` in the DOM even if the corresponding tags don't appear in our HTML, since a fundamental tenet of the web is permissiveness; they always do their best to display HTML even when it has errors.
