* DOM

  * Object representation of an HTML document. It provides a way to interact with a web page using JavaScript.

  * JavaScript is the syntax, the DOM is where stuff goes down. A DOM node can be a DOM element, a text node, a comment, or other types. DOM nodes have properties.

  * Browsers insert missing elements like `HEAD` and `BODY` in the DOM even if the corresponding tags don't appear in our HTML, since a fundamental tenet of the web is permissiveness; they always do their best to display HTML even when it has errors.

* Recursion in the DOM: Walking the tree

* Array-like objects: Containers for other objects indexed by non-negative integers. Generally don't support array abstraction methods;
