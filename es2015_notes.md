- Arrows and Lexical This
  - arrows are different from functions:
    - share same `this` context as surrounding code;
    - if inside another function, shares the `arguments` variable of the parent function;
  - Put another way: does not have its own `this`, `arguments`, `super`, or `new.target`;
  - Better suited for non-method functions;
  - Cannot be used as constructors;
  - Arrow functions do not have a prototype property;
  - Parentheses are optional when there's only one parameter;
  - Parenthesize the body of function to return an object literal expression: `params => ({foo: bar})`;
  - Since arrow functions do not have their own this, the methods call() or apply() can only pass in parameters. thisArg is ignored;
  - arrow functions don't have their own arguments object. use rest parameters as an alternative;
  - Use non-arrow functions for methods that will be called using the object.method() syntax. Those are the functions that will receive a meaningful this value from their caller.
  - Use arrow functions for everything else. (https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/06/es6-in-depth-arrow-functions/)

- Enhanced Object Literals
  - Shorthand method definition:
  ```javascript
  // ES6 with method syntax
    {
      ...
      addAll(pieces) {
        _.each(pieces, piece => this.add(piece));
      },
      ...
    }
  ```

- Default + Rest + Spread
  - READ https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/05/es6-in-depth-rest-parameters-and-defaults/
  -  Rest: represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array.
    - `function len(...theArgs) { return theArgs.length } // len(1, 2, 3) returns 3`;
  - (param1 = defaultValue1, param2, â€¦, paramN = defaultValueN) => { statements }

- Let + Const
  - Block scoped (like in `if (true) { let name = 'Fido' }`); `var` is function scoped;
  0 Unlike variables declared with var, which will start with the value undefined, let variables are not initialized until their definition is evaluated;
  - Can't be declared twice;
  - Unlike var, does not create a property on the global object;
  - Let is the new `var`: variable can be reassigned;
  - Const: can't be reassigned;
    - But the value it references can still be mutated;
    - An initializer for a constant is required; that is, you must specify its value in the same statement in which it's declared (which makes sense, given that it can't be changed later).

- Iterators + For..Of
  - `for...in`

- Promises
  - A returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function.
  - extremely useful for async success/failure, because you're less interested in the exact time something became available, and more interested in reacting to the outcome. (https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/promises#events_arent_always_the_best_way)
